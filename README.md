# Welcome to CS1
#### Web Development
___
## Course Description
CS1 teaches you the foundations of web development. In addition to learning the languages that make up most of what you see on the internet, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we will also be diving into the design theory that makes a website look _beautiful_. 

Whether you want to create _beautiful websites_ to raise awareness about different issues affecting our communities, make a [_visualizer_](https://preziotte.com/partymode/) for your favorite music, create a [_game_](http://patorjk.com/games/snake/), or even create the next [_Instagram_](https://medium.com/@eduoshaun/build-an-instagram-app-from-scratch-in-express-js-ea0c969e6c52), by the end of the course you will have the fundamentals to make your brilliant ideas a reality... and share them with the rest of the world! 

I hope you are just as excited as I am to learn something new every week, get a little better each day, and build cool things on the internet!
